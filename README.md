# ModelAggregation
 
This repository contains the different examples presented in our paper: [Model aggregation: minimizing empirical variance outperforms minimizing empirical error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17267). 

We have:
* [The pathological examples](./pathological_cases)
* [The Boston housing dataset](./boston-housing)
* [The Laplace Equation PDE solving](./laplace)
* [The Burgers Equation PDE solving](./burgers)

In each folder, you will find a main notebook, as well as additional files and notebooks to get the data or generate it.
